Why Java?

WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere
tremendous library support
automatic memory allocation ( no pointers! =) )
OOP- however it does have some features that are not OOP like primitives and lambdas
strongly and statically typed

JDK- Java Developement Kit . Only people writing java applications need this
it turns Java Code in a .java file to byte code in a .class file
javac -command prompt

JRE- Java Runtime Environment. This has the resources and classes necessary
to actually run a Java application
java - command prompt

JVM- Java Virtual Machine. This is essentially the engine that processes bytecode.
Virtual processors/registers memory


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory in Java
Automatic memory allocation
An object is marked for garbage collection when it can no longer be reached by the application.
All references to it are gone
garbage collection occurs when Java feels like it
We can request but not enforce garbage collection with System.gc

Heap - Where all objects live
Stack - Called methods are stored


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OOP
paradigm of programming wherein we build applications areound classes and objects

class- is a blueprint for an object
object - an instance of a class

Abstraction- hiding an implementation - not necessary to know how something works
	abstract classes, abstract methods. and interfaces

Polymorphism- one object many labels
	static polymorphism - overloading this happens at compile time
	dynamic polymorphism - overriding this happens at runtime
	ability to label an object as several different types

Inheritance - Reusing code in other classes
	extends keyword


Encapsulation - Protecting variables an methods and code
access modifiers


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

access modifiers
public - accessible anywhere in the application
protected - same package with the loophole of classes in other packages that inherit from
default - Only in the same package
private - Only in the same class


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Constructors
allocates memory for and builds an object
the new keyword allocates memory technically

Java provides a default no args constructor only if you do not provide constructors
The first line in a constructor is always super even if you do not write it
you can call a constructor of the same class if you use the this() as the first

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keywords
-final make a value unchangeable, make a method unable to be overriden, class unable to be inherited
-static makes a method of variable attached to the class not to any one instance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

String-
IS NOT A PRIMITIVE
-object designed to hold character data
-Strings use the string pool to save memory
-The string pool is a special part of the Heap where strings of the same value
share the same memory address/object
-String in immutable aka a final class

Stringbuilder- Is a mutable version of string
StringBuffer- Is a thread safe version of String

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exceptions
-Exceptions are objects that are thrown when code executes in an unhappy path
-Exceptions can and should be handled by the programmer
-Errors are catastrophic problems that should not be caught
-They both inherit from throwable and therefore can be caught

compile time or checked exceptions - Must be handled by the programmer
runtime exceptions - Can or cannot be handled

try - code you want to run
catch - code to run when an exception is caught
finally - code that will always run
only one catch block will ever execute

must write catch blocks from most specific to least specific exception

throw- sends an exception into the application
Throws- ducks an exception is part of the method signature (Its a warning)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object class
All objects inherit from the object class
toString(), hashcode(), equals()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract class - class that cannot be instantiated
abstract method is a method with a signature but no implementation

Interface - cannot be instantiated
classes implement an interface to add methods/behavior
public static final variables
methods are abstract by default
can you use the default keyword to not make them abstract

marker interface- interface with nothing in it. Sole purpose is to give object a type

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wrapper class
the object version of a primitive

autoboxing - primitive -> wrapper
unboxing - wrapper -> primitive

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collections

Java Collections Framework - set of objects designed to hold other objects
The root interface is iterable. The collection interface extends iterable
\-Map is not iterable (black shepp of the collection framework)
map is a key value pair

-List - preserved the order of insertion and allows duplicates
- Set - does not preserve order of insertion and no duplicates

tree - ordered
hash - unordered

generics are the <> that allow us to specify the type of object that belongs in a collection

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File IO

BufferedReader - to read in a file (text)
BufferedWriter - to write a file (text)

FileInputStream - to read in a file (bytes)
FileOutputStream - to write to a file (bytes)
