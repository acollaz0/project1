Web Server- is a computer that is designed to handle
HTTP requests. 

Servlet- Is a Java Object designed to handle incoming requests
not solely HTTP. Servlets can generate responses and
process requests using Java Logic

Servlet Container- it contains one to many Servlets and it primarily responsible
for mapping the servlets to different addresses. Configure 
our servlets.

Tomcat - is a server designed by Apache that will host our house our servlet container.

web.xml (Deplotment Descriptor) - gives the servlet Container mapping
and configurationg details
decides what requests are handled by a servlet


Servlet Lifecycle
1. Servlet Class is loaded into the servlet Container
2. Servlet class is instantiated 
3. Servlet's init() method is called the init method of the servlet class
    is run only once and sets up initial configuration/parameters
    -lazy init() is called upon the first request to a servlet
    -eager init() is called as soon as the application starts
4. Servlet service() method is called upon each request to the 
servlet. The service method delegates the request to
doGet(), doPost(), doDelete()...
5. Servlet destroy() method is only called once and that is when
the application is shit down

ServletConfig - is an object specific to a single servlet
that holds information on that servlet

ServletContext - is an object that holds information about the
entire servlet container and this all servlets

uri - Uniform Resource Identifier 
 - identifies a file or resource/servlet

url - Uniform Resource Locator
host + port + uri

Forward - occurs on the server side and sends a request from one servlet to another.

Redirect - is when a resource tells the client to send another
request to a different location

Session handling

1. HttpSession object - this will keep track of the session server side
2. Cookies to store information client side

Do not recommend list
3. url rewriting
4. Hidden Forms
