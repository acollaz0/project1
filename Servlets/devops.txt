Devops is a mindset wherin programs are developed, tested, and operated on at the same time
-Automate everything you can

Cloud Computing- Abstracting ownership of physical hardware and computers
to the web. We are removing the physical infrastructure required to create a software
project/service.

advantages of Cloud Computing

Elasticity - commission and decommission resources (computers/databases) as necessary
Happens dynamically. Meet the demand that is appropriate.

Scalability - 

Vertical - Taking one computer and increases its cpu or memory or storage
not increasing the amount of machines

Horizontal - commissioning more machines to handle current needs

In cloud computing you often only pay for hwat use and by the hour

Cloud computing can offer 3 types of services

IaaS Infrastructure as a Service
-using the cloud to abstract hardware
ec2 or virtual machinesbuy processing time

PaaS Platform as a Service
-foundation for you to develope on
RDS

SaaS Software as a Service
-Completed product provided over the web
Google Drive or Netflix

DevOps pipeline- The modern approach to developement

Continuous Integration - A group of programmers will work together useing a SCM
source code manager (GitHub) and after a push the program will be compiled and tested
Pushes can trigger an automatic build

Continuous Delivery - Extension to CI wherin the sompleted program will be
put into some staging area. Deployment Ready but not actually being used.
Someone will manually approve that it goes live

Continuous Deployment - Extension to CD wherein if it passes the automated tests the
application does live immediately for use


AWS - Amazon Web Services

-Largest cloud computing service 

Regions- geographical areas where services are provided
(Ohio, North Virginia, Tokyo)

Availability Zones - Data centers within a region that provide resiliency and backups to each other



EC2- Elastic Compute Cloud
-a vm
-literally just another computer somethere else in the world
-Use an os of your choice you can specialize the 'hardware' i.e. more ram or cpu 

EBS- Elastic Block Store 
-the virtual hardrive to an ec2
-expand or replace an EBS as needed

ELB - Elastic Load Balancing
-spreads out requests for services to multiple EC2s

AMI- Amazon Machine Image
-Its essentially a snapshot of a machine and setup
-It includes the os for the EC2

Security Group - virtual firewall to protect your computer

VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
this is an absrtaction of having a local network

IAM - Identity Access Management
-This is a way to control who has access to your AWS account
-and what they can do 

S3 - Simple Storage Service
-Designed to hold data as files (Similar to Dropbox)

Route53- Domain name service
-Amazon will give your ec2 a proper website name


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maven
-developed by apache
-Dependency Manager and build automation tool

Maven Goals

clean - will remove the compiled source code in the target folder
compile - will compile source code
package - Package your code and run tests
install - will put your package in the local .m2 directory
Deploy - copy a war/jar to a remote repo
