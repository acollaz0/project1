Hamster to Ham

Java
-Statically typed. A variable's type has to be declared
i.e. int num x;

-Server side language
You see it on the backend of web applications
exception is jsp

-Compiled language
we write code and then it compiles
and the result is what you actually run

-Has classes and classical inheritence
we use classes as blueprints to create objects

-Java has access modifiers

-has 4 scopes

-Datatypes primitives and objects 

-Java is pass by value

-OOP based

JavaScript
-Loosly typed You do not need to declare a variables type
x=100;

-Primarily a client side language
node.js is bering used to write server side Javascript

--Scripting language (Just in Time Compilation) JIT
the program compiles and runs at the same time

-No classes and prototypical inheritence
an object references another object as a prototype to build off of
*ES6 ECMA added a Class keyword to simulate classes in js

-no access modifiers

Javascript has 3 but we should really only use 2

Datatypes primitives and objects
a function is an object

-JS is both pass by valu eand pass by refereence

-Multi Paradigmed programming language it has oop capabilities
it is heavily influenced
