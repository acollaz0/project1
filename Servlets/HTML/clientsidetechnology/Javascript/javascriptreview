JavaScript Review
-Scripting language, just in time compiled, compiles and runs simultaneously
-Dynamic/loose/interpretive typing
-Multi paradigmed language (Functional with support for oop)
-no classes and therfore cannot have classical inheritence

js is a single threaded language

prototypical
-You create an object and then that object is the base for another object

Datatypes in JavaScript

primitives are pass by value - 
String, Number, null, undefined, boolean
Objects are pass by reference - object, array, function

Variable scopes
-global - no declaration
-function - var
-block - let & const

Hoisting
"feature" werein declarations are hoisted to the top of the scope
but not the actual value

functions-
1. are Objects
2. can be anonymous 
3. can be hoisted 

self invoking functions (function(){some code})();

arrow notation let foo = (param) =>{}

callback function - it is a function passed in as a parameter

closure - is when a function within a funciton has access to variables 
defined in the outer function 
fucntion returns another function


template literal - denoted by `` backticks
way of storing string information 
provides for interpolation

Objects - key value pairs

let person = {
    name : "adam"
    profession : "trainer"
    train : function(){
        some code
    }
}
person.train()

JSON vs JSO
JSO - key value pairs used for performing and programming

JSON - Just a string format
{"name":"Adam","age":19}

JSON do not contain functions
The purpose of a JSON is to provide a very easy and common format
for programmers to communicate with

truthy falsy
JavaScript type coersion at play
== which performs type coercion
=== which does not

NaN is always even against itself.

DOM
-Document Object Model
connected nodes or tree 

eventlisteners- Its a trap set on an element or action that happens on the page 
element.addEventListener("event",code to execute, bubble?)

bubbling is when JavaScript executes from the innermost element out 
capturing is the outermost element in 

Simulate classes in JavaScript by using closures and having the returning
function be the constructor

AJAX call
1. Make an xmlhttprequest() object
2. onreadystatechange needs to be given a function to exectute
3. open the object (http verb and url)
4. you need to send it

HTML - Hyoer Text Markup Language
not a programming language

elements - building blocks for web page
attributes - properties for elements adjectives

css 
Cascading Style Sheets
makes your webpages look nice

Cascade algorithm- Determines what ultmiate style is applied to an element
the more specific style is applied

selectors
id
class 
tag
