JavaScript Basics

Java has zero relation to JavaScript

Java:
-Statically typed: A variable type has to be declared (int num)
-Primarily server side language. Used for backend, except for java server pages (jsp)
-Java is a compiled language: We write the code, and then it compiles, and that result 
is what is actually run.
-Java has classes and classical inheritance: Use classes as blueprints to create objects
-Java has access modifiers
-Has four scopes
-Is only pass by value
-Very OOP based

JavaScript:
-Interpretive/Loosely typed: You do not need to declare a variable's type (x=100)
-Primarily client side, though node.js can be used to write server side JavaScript
-Scripting Language (just in time compilation): The program compiles and runs at the same time.
-Has no classes (sort of), and prototypical inheritance. Object references another object as a prototype
to build off of. *ES6 added a class keyword to javascript to simulate classes in javascript
-Has no access modifiers
-Has three scopes, but should only really use two
-Has datatypes, both primitives and objects. In javascript, a function is an object.
- is both pas by value and pass by reference
-"Multiparadigmed" language. Has OOP capabilities, but is heavily influenced by functional programming
