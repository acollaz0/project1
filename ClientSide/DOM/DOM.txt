DOM - Document Object Model
It is a way to present an html page as a series of connected nodes
JavaScript allows us to manipulate the DOM to create dynamic webpages.
The DOM is a way of representing nested tags, basically:
<body>
    <h1></h1>
    <p><b></b>
    </p>
    <div>
        <table></table>
    </div>
</body>

Becomes a tree, with the body tag as the first node of the tree, and h1, p, and div as the first child nodes of body

Event Listeners:
-An event is a user action or something that occurs on the page. (click, mouseover, load, etc.)
-action function or code to be called when an event has been triggered.
- Event listener/Event handler are used synonymously, though they are slightly different. (as the names suggest)
Using an event:
1: grab an element (ex: document.getElementByID("id"))
2: add the event listener element.addEventListener()
    parameters for addEventListener:
    first: the event you are listening for (a string representation)
    second: the code or function to be executed when the event occurs
    third: whether or not the element should perform capturing or bubbling (optional param?)
