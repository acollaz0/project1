/* This is what a comment in css looks like.
        
With CSS, you'll have a selector to identify elements to be selected
then you'll have a declaration which will give some property a value for that element.
*/

/* here, the b is the selector which chooses all bold tags
the color and value are the declaration (property:value). Can have as many properties as you want.*/
b{ color:darkblue }
body{background-color: slategray}
/* there are three types of selectors
1: Select by element (b, body, p, etc.) 
2: Use the element id with a hashtag 
3: use the element class with a dot*/
#GatorHeading{color: peru}
h3.champ{color: salmon}
table.champ{color: springgreen}
/* Can also write css externally */
