What is a design pattern?

It is an established convention for solving a software problem.
Aka: an approach/technique for solving a certain type of problem.

Patterns will have distinctive features, but can be implemented slightly differently.(Whatever that means)

Use patterns because they promote extensibility, are low maintenance, and make code more readable (because it's a convention).

Singleton (an example of a design pattern): a solution where you only ever want one instance of a class.
