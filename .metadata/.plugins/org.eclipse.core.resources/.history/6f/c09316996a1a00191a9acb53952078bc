Thread is the smallest units of command that can be executed.
Like a small process

Multithreading is a technique where we use multiple threads and multiple processors to speed up calculation and efficiency.

Can have code execute in parallel

In java there is a daemon thread, aka the main thread. When this thread ends, the program is over.
This thread can generate other threads. 

The thread lifecycle:
- new: a thread is created
- runnable: a thread is able to be run but is not necessarily doing anything
- running: a thread is executing
- terminated: the thread is done

- blocked: a thread can be prevented from running for some reason, usually a thread conflict
