Thread is the smallest units of command that can be executed
Think of them as small process

Multithreading is a technique in which we use multiple threads and multiple processors
To speed up calculation and efficiency

Code execute in parallel

In Java you have a daemon thread which is the main thread. When this thread ends the
program is over. This thread can generate other threads. daemon spawns are child threads

Thread Lifecycle
new - A thread is created
runnable - A thread is able to be run but is not necessarily doing anything
running - A thread is executing
terminated - the thread is done

blocked - prevented from running for some reason

Scheduler - REsponsoble for blocing and freeing threads and trying to optimize thread
throughput

Deadlock - Hostage exchange where no one trusts eachother Each thread has a resource that
the other wants but will not grant access to their own resource until the other is complete

Alivelock - (CanadianLock) Both threads are to polite and each want to give away a 
resource to continue

priority - the order in which a thread should 'go'
		minimum 1 maximum 10
