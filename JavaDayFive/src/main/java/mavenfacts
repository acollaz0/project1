Maven is a tool for build automation and build management
We have to import packages all the time to have out applications
Java has a lot of packages already built into it collections
The native Java packages get to be cool and use java.anything.anything

the oldschool way to add new packages in java code to an application was to 
download a .jar file and manually build it into your class path when
designing an application. This is tedious and prone to error.

Maven will do build automation updates for packages for us
The heart of Maven is the pom.xml

pom.xml (Project Object Model) A configration file for your java Application.
It will contain things such as the name of the project. The packages used in the project
what version of Java to compile as. If you want the tests you've written for it to be run automatically once it's built
