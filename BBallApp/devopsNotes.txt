DevOps: a mindset where programs are developed, tested, and operated on at the same time.
-Automate everything that you can. From testing, to development, to delivery

DevOps Pipeline: The modern approach to development.

	-Continuous Integration: A group of programmers will work together using a SCM (Source code manager 
	like github, svn), and after a push the program will be compiled and tested. Pushes can trigger 
	automatic builds
	
	-Continuous Delivery: Extention to continuous integration, whereing the completed program will be put into some staging area.
	Considered deployment ready, but not actually being used. Someone will manually approve that it goes live.
	
	-Continuous Deployment: Extension continuous delivery, where if app passes automated tests, the application
	immediately goes live for general use.

Cloud Computing:
	-In the past, all the computers you would need for your company/organization would be on site. You would 
	own all the servers and have the hardware physically with you.
	-Cloud computing is abstracting ownershi of physical hardware and computers to the web. We are removing the 
	physical infrastructure required to create software projects/services.
	
	
Many advantages to cloud computing:
	-Elasticity: can commission and decomission resources (i.e.: computers/databases) as necessary. 
	Happens Dynamically. Allows you to meet demand as appropriate.
	
	-Scalability: Related to elasticity.
		Vertical - Taking one computer and increasing its cpu/memory/storage. Not increasing the amount of
		machines.
		Horizontal - Comissioning more or less machines to handle current needs.

In cloud computing, you often only pay for what you use, and by the hour. 

Cloud computing can offer three types of services:
	-Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): Using the cloud to abstract hardware (ec2, virtual machines,
	buying processing time like on MARCC)
	
	-Platform as a service (PaaS): Similar to IaaS. Provides more like a foundation for you to develop on. RDS is
	an example. 
	
	-Software as a service (SaaS): A completed produce available over the web, like google drive or netflix.
	
	
AWS - Amazon Web Services:
	-Largest cloud computing service.
	-IBM, microsoft, and google have their own cloud computing services.
	
	-Regions: geographical areas where AWS services are provided. 
		Availability zones: the datacenters within a region that provide resiliency and backups to each other.

Some AWS services:

	EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud
	-An ec2 is a VM. Literally just another computer somwhere else in the world.
	-Amazon allows you to use an OS of your choice. Can specialize the "hardware", 
	with more processing power/memory
	
	Windows password for bballApp:
	IyK;=gKz8E.fxglZykckOb7JNV!GIkt%
	
	EBS: Elastic block store
	-The virtual hard drive to an ec2.
	-can expand or replace your EBS as needed.
	
	ELB: Elastic Load Balancing
	-Spreading out requests for services to multiple EC2s.
	
	AMI: Amazon Machine Image
	-Essentially a snapshot of a machine and its setup.
	-Includes the OS for the ec2

	Security Groups
	-Essentially a virtual firewall to protect your computer.
	
	VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
	-An abstraction of having a local network
	-Only intended to connect cloud machines/services
	
	IAM: Identity Access Management
	-Control who has access to your AWS account, and what they can do.
	
	S3: Simple Storage Service
	-Designed to hold data as files, similar to dropbox.
	
	Route53: Domain name service
	-Amazon will give your EC2 a proper website name.
	
	
------
Maven:
	-Built by apache.
	-It is a dependency manager and build automation.
	
Maven Goals:
	-clean: will remove the compiled source code in the target folder
	-compile: will compile source code
	-package: package your code and run tests
	-install: will put your package in the local .m2 directory.
	-deploy: copy a war/jar file to a remote repo

AWS service presentation:
give 4-5 minute presentation with partner about a specific service, along with short study guide about service.
