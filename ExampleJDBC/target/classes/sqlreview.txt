RDBMS - Relation Database Management System
software designed to manage a Database
examples oracle sql developer, PostGres, MySQL, WinowsSQLServer

Database - a collection of objects designed to hold information
Relation Database - A Database which holds information in tables
related to each other

Table - composed of columns called fields which hold attributes
and rows called records which model an instance

SQL - Structured Query Language

DDL = (Data Definition Language) - Defines the rules and structures
truncate, create, alter, and drop

DML - (Data Manipulation Language) - Adds removes or edits data in the
database. Insert, delete, set, and update.

DQL - (Data Query Language) - for reading information
SELECT

DCL - (Data Control Language) - for granting permissions to users

TCL - (Transaction Control Language) - for generating transactions
commit, rollback, savepoint

clauses in SQL
where - specific condition to be met
group by - arrange results into bundles/groups used for aggregate functions
having - used with group by because you cannot use where
order by - rearranges the presentation of the results but not what records are returned
and/or - conditionals

constraints - rules that we put on a table
Primary Key - unique identifier for a record
(composite key) - combination of two or more columns to create a primary key

Foreign Key - establishes a relationship to another table
the table that has the foreign key is the child

Unique - all values must be unique

default - set a default value for a column

not null - value cannot be null

referential integrity - the use of keys to prevent orphan records

orphan records - records who reference a record/parent who no long exists

PL/SQL

Procedure - set of SQL commands/code that is essentially a script
a procedure can have 0 to any number of inputs. 0 to any number of outputs
can actually change values in the database
compiled once and stored


function - has at least 1 input. Always 1 output
never changes data in the database
compiled each time

Trigger - code to be executed when a certain event occurs on a table

Multiplicities
1-1
1-many
many-many Junction Table

Sequence - Database object to generate numbers




normalization - process of reducing redundancy in a database
(not always what we want)

1nf - all data is atomic. single piece of information i.e. breaking down an address
Each record is uniquely identifiable i.e. primary key

2nf - in 1nf and there are no functional dependencies 
(you cannot calculate the value of another field)

3nf in 2nf and there are no transitive dependencies
(you cannot find that value anywhere else in the database)

transaction - A logical unit of sql commands
oracle transactions obey ACID

Atomic - all statements in a transaction succeed or none of them do

Consistency - the database moves from one consistent committed state to another

Isolation - concurrent transactions do not cause consistency issues*

Durable - Durable transactions fail gracefully and do not cause your database to crash some other awful happening

Isolation levels - 
read uncommitted - cardinal sin of databases 
allows for dirty reads reading uncommitted data

read committed - allows for nonrepeatable reads
a record found at the start of the transaction cannot be found at the end

repeatable read - allows for phantom reads
a record not found at the beginning of the transaction is found at the end

serializable - allows for no consistency errors
is slow because transactions cannot run concurrently

joins - combine two tables horizontally based on some type of predicate
i.e. "on player.team = team.name"

left join
right join
cross join cartesian product
natural join
inner join
full outer join
outer join
theta join a predicate other than equals

unions - combine two tables vertically based on
they have the same number and type of columns

JDBC - Java Data Base Connectivity
a java library with classes to connect to a database
interfaces of JDBC

Connection -- used to connect to a database
PreparedStatement protects against sql injection sanitizes inputs to the sql query
Statement -- just pure sql string
CallableStatement -- used for calling procedures
ResultSet -- stores the results from a query
