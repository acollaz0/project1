What is a design pattern?

It is an established convention for solving a software problem.
Aka: an approach/technique for solving a certain type of problem.

Patterns will have distinctive features, but can be implemented slightly differently.(Whatever that means)

Use patterns because they promote extensibility, are low maintenance, and make code more readable (because it's a convention).

Singleton (an example of a design pattern): a solution where you only ever want one instance of a class. 
All singletons should have a private constructor. Should have a method for determining if an instance exists, 
	and if one doesn't, then create one
Example: Useful to encapsulate a database connection, so that there is only ever one connection.
