What is a design pattern?

It is an established convention for solving a software problem/issue.
Aka: an approach/technique for solving a certain type of problem.

Patterns will have distinctive features, but can be implemented slightly differently.(Whatever that means)

Use patterns because they promote extensibility, are low maintenance, and make code more readable (because it's a convention).

Singleton (an example of a design pattern): a solution where you only ever want one instance of a class. 
All singletons should have a private constructor. Should have a method for determining if an instance exists, 
	and if one doesn't, then create one
Example: Useful to encapsulate a database connection, so that there is only ever one connection. Also good for a Logger class, so all logs go to
same place

Factory (A design pattern):  When you need an object to perform some functionality. You know what needs doing and the inputs, but not the class
The factory will create an object with the appropriate class, and you will use that object through an interface.
