Thread is the smallest units of command that can be executed.
Like a small process

Multithreading is a technique where we use multiple threads and multiple processors to speed up calculation and efficiency.

Can have code execute in parallel

In java there is a daemon thread, aka the main thread. When this thread ends, the program is over.
This thread can generate other threads. 

The thread lifecycle:
- new: a thread is created
- runnable: a thread is able to be run but is not necessarily doing anything
- running: a thread is executing
- terminated: the thread is done

- blocked: a thread can be prevented from running for some reason, usually a thread conflict

Issues with threads:
Scheduler: Respnsible for blocking and freeing threads, and trying to optimize thread throughput.

Deadlock: When each thread has a resource that the other thread wants, but will not grant the other access until the other grants access first.
kind of like a hostage situation.

Livelock: When two threads are trying to give each other priority to use their resource
Priority: essentially the order in which a thread should go. Minimum priority is 1, max is 10. Threads with higher priority 
would be given access first

Create threads by implementing the Runnable interface or extending the Thread class
Threading is a way to increase efficient use of processing power
