JavaScript to Java 
Hamster to Ham 

Java - statically typed
A variable's type has to be declared
i.e. int num x = 100;

-Server side language
You see it on the backend of web applications
exception is jsp 

-Compiled language
we write code and then it compiles 
and the result is what you can actually run

-Has classes and classical inheritance
we use classes as blueprints to create objects

-Java has access modifiers

-Java has 4 scopes

-Java only passed by value

-Java very OOP based

JavaScript - Loosely typed. You do not need to declare a variables type
x = 100;

-Primarily a client side language
node.js is being used to write server side JavaScript

-Scripting language (Just in Time Compilation) JIT 
the program compiles and runs at the same time 

-No classes and has prototypical inheritance 
an object references another object as a prototype to build off of 
*ES6 ECMA added a Class keyword to simulate classes in JavaScript

-no access modifiers 

-JavaScript has 3 scopes but we should only really use two

-DataTypes primitives and objects
a function is a object

-JavaScript is both pass by value and pass by reference

-Multi-paradigmed programming language
it has oop capabilities it is heavily influenced by functional
programming
