Devops is a mindset wherein programs are developed tested and operated on at the same time
-Automate everything you can

Cloud Computing - Abstracting ownership of physical hardware and computers to the web.
we are removing the physical infastructure required to create a software project/service

advantages of cloud computing
Elasticity - commission and decommission resources(computers/databases etc) as necessary
Happens dynamically. Meet the demand that is appropriate.


Scalability - 

Vertical - Taking one computer and increasing its cpu or memory or storage
not increasing the amount of machines

Horizontal - Commissioning more machines to handle current needs

In cloud computing you often* only pay for what you use and by the hour

Cloud computing can offer 3 types of services

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS
- using the cloud the abstract hardware
ec2 or virtual machines
buy processing time

Platform as a Service PaaS
- foundation for you to develop on 
RDS

Software as a Service SaaS
- Completed product provided over the web
Google Drive or Netflix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DevOps pipeline- The modern approach to development

Continuous integration - A group of programmers will work together using a SCM source code manager
(github) and after a push the program will be compiled and tested
Pushes can trigger an automatic build

Continuous Delivery - Extension to CI wherein the completed program will be put into some staging area
Deployment ready but not actually being used.Someone will manually approve that it goes live.

Continuous Deployment - Extension to CD wherein if it passes the automated tests the application
goes live immediately  for use




AWS - Amazon Web services
-Largest cloud computing service

Regions - geographical areas where services are provided
(ohio, North Virginia, Tokyo)

Availability Zones - Data centers within a region that provide resiliency and
backups to each other

AWS Services

EC2 - Elastic Computer Cloud
-a vm
-literally just another computer somewhere else in the world
-Use an OS of your choice you can specialize the 'hardware' i.e. more ram or better cpu

EBS - Elastic Block Store
- virtual harddrive to an EC2
- expand or replace an EBS as needed

ELB - Elastic Load Balancing
-this is spreading out requests for services to multiple EC2s

AMI - Amazon Machine Image
- its essentially a snapshot of a machine and setup
- it includes the OS for the EC2

Security Group - virtual firewall to proect your computer

VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
-this is an abstraction of having a local network

IAM - Identity Access Management 
-This is a way to control who has access to your AWS account
- and what they can do

S3 - Simple Storage Service
-Designed to hold data as files(similar to Dropbox)

Route53 - Domain name service
-Amazon will give your EC2 a proper website name

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maven
-developed by apache
-Dependancy Manager and build automation

Maven Goals

clean - will remove the compiled source code in the target folder 
compile - will compile your source code
package - Package your code and run tests
install - will put your package in the local .m2 directory
deploy - to copy a war/jar file to a remote repo
